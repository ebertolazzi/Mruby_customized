Note on Windows build
=====================

Current version builds on Windows 7, provided that the files pcre.h and pcre3.lib are available under C:/Windows/system.

Look on [http://www.airesoft.co.uk/pcre](www.airesoft.co.uk) for a prebuilt version of PCRE.

Check and edit the mrbgem.rake accordingly.
